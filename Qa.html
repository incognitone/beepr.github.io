So here is a short Q&A session which also elaborates our philosophy behind the application.
<br><br>
<h1>Beepr</h1>
<br>
How many Facebook friends does everyone have? How many of these friends have you 

actually seen or spoken? Could be never, or perhaps just once. In the meantime, these 'friends' 

will know a lot about you, as far as you allow personal information on your profile.

<br><br><br>The Beepr app anticipates on this situation, by starting a conversation with a person, without 

having to be stuck to this person, you could delete and stop the chat at any given time. 

Where Facebook does give you personal information on a person, the Beepr app will not 

provide any information, no number nor name nor location.

<br><br>This file will document any questions that can be asked or are already asked by fellow students 

regarding Beepr.

<h3>What differentiates Beepr from other chat apps and why is it more useful?</h3>

Of course, there are a lot of other chat apps, which are very popular, simple and effective.

So why would we even design another chat app, the idea isn't that original. 

The thing that differentiates Beepr compared to other chat apps is the fact that you will gain 

complete anonymity, there are no strings attached. Your contacts will not have any name, you 

will not need a number, nor any Facebook data. The only requirement, is matching two devices 

by using a sound signal. This signal includes a key which will have to authenticate with another 

device, which will result in a conversation between the hosts, while maintaining your anonymity, 

so no personal information whatsoever.

<h3>Why don't we use Bluetooth to connect two devices?</h3>

- Trustability, since the connection is acquired by sending a sound.

<br>- No possibility of connection interference, we have complete control over communication.

<br>- It is much faster, there will be no delay for establishing a connection between two devices 

(Searching for devices, request for connection)

<h3>Why the use of sound?</h3>

We wanted to come up with something original and the most of all we wanted to create a way 

of establishing a connection without having to provide any personal information. Also to make 

sure there are no miscommunications, such as providing the wrong phone number. <br>By using 

the sound you will have a guarantee that the chat session will be created and the best part of it, 

providing no personal data. You are able to delete the chat and never hear from the person in 

question again.

<h3>Isn't there already a similar chatapp?</h3>

We are all familiar with the alternative chatapps, that work with contacts and phone numbers, 

such as Whatsapp and Telegram. Beepr is actually something completely different, since we 

use a sound signal for creating a conversation and an app using this mechanism doesn't exist.

<br><br>We did get inspired by an app named 'Chirp', this app uses a sound signal to transfer an image 

from one to device to the other. This mechanism is very much alike Beepr's mechanism, but we 

implemented a chat system.

<h3>How will you able to distinguish several contacts if you don't have any information about 

them?</h3>

Because you are not able to create your own username, it might be difficult to distinguish 

several contacts in your contact list, when you quickly want to contact someone. 

To solve this problem, we designed a Random Nickname-Generator for this app, where every 

contact will receive a random username from the server, which will appear on the screen. This 

username consists of 2 random words, first being an adjective and the second being a name. 

<br><br>We also included a Random Avatar-Generator in the app, which makes sure every contact will 

not only have a random username, but also a random 'profile picture'.

These random nicknames and avatars are combined with the feature that the most recent or 

most used chats will appear at the top of your contact list, to easily keep track of contacts, while 

still maintaining your anonymity.

<h3>How is a conversation anonymous, when in order to create one, you will require a 

physical interaction with a certain person?</h3>

The keyword in Beepr is anonymity. But then again, it is not anonymity in the fullest meaning of 

the word. You could see Beepr as the contrary of the Internet, where you might have never 

seen or spoken a certain person, but still you could have a lot of personal data on that person.

Our anonymity can be seen as some kind of safety, you will be untraceable for your contacts.

'No strings attached' and no providing of information.

<h3>Benefits of anonymity:</h3>

No providing of personal data, e.g. phone numbers, names, usernames. Also when you're 

chatting with a person, this person will not be able to distribute your data to his/her friend, 

because the person in question will have no information about you -> Anonymous.

You will not be stuck to anyone, as soon as you decide to stop a conversation with a person, 

you can simply delete the chat and all evidence of existence will be wiped out. You will not be 

able to contact this person again, since you do not have anything on them. 

The only way you will be able to start a conversation with this person again is by matching with 

him again, when meeting the person in real life.

<br><br>The biggest advantage about the anonymity is security. You can feel absolutely secure when 

using this app because we have the complete anonymity principle. 

<br><br>The sound responds to very specific frequencies. These frequencies are chosen to be higher 

than the frequency which we talk with, so even in a room with a lot of background noise or white 

noise, the app will still be able to recognize the sounds and establish a chat. This also gives 

advantages for any kind of miscommunication, when you want to make use of an app that does 

use personal information. Providing the wrong number or the wrong name or not understanding 

it very well, is no problem when using Beepr and it's sound mechanism.
